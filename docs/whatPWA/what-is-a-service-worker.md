# What is a Service Worker

Service workers are scripts that your browser runs in the background and act as a network proxy in the web browser to manage the web/HTTP requests programmatically.
Service Workers lie between the network and device to supplement the content enabling the creation of effective offline experiences using the cache mechanisms. They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs.
